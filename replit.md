# AI-Mobile-Gentrit-Hyseni

## Project Overview
This project was imported from the GitHub repository "AI-Mobile-GH" by Gentrit Hyseni. The original repository was empty (containing only a README), so a basic web application structure has been created to provide a starting point for development.

## Current State
- **Status**: Running and operational
- **Last Updated**: October 10, 2025
- **Framework**: Simple Python HTTP server serving static HTML
- **Port**: 5000 (frontend)

## Project Structure
```
.
├── index.html          # Main landing page
├── server.py          # Python HTTP server with cache control
├── README.md          # Original repository README
└── replit.md          # This documentation file
```

## How It Works
- **Server**: Python 3.11 with built-in http.server module
- **Host Configuration**: 0.0.0.0:5000 (configured for Replit environment)
- **Cache Control**: Disabled to ensure updates are immediately visible

## Workflow Configuration
- **Workflow Name**: Server
- **Command**: `python server.py`
- **Output Type**: Web view
- **Port**: 5000

## Next Steps
To build your AI Mobile application:
1. Add your application code and features
2. Install necessary dependencies (frameworks, libraries)
3. Expand the frontend with your desired UI/UX
4. Add backend API functionality if needed
5. Integrate AI capabilities

## Notes
- The original GitHub repository contained only a README file
- This basic structure provides a foundation to start building
- The server is configured to work with Replit's proxy/iframe environment
